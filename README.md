# 15 Puzzle Game
Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle

Built in React, mostly for fun and as a challenge to myself! Making a random game is always a treat and a nice breather from other projects. 

Click a tile next to the empty spot to move the tile into the empty spot! Try to arrange the board to be in numerical order with the empty square at the bottom right!
